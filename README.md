# LSTM_Neural-Networks

Having used ARIMA time series forecasts in the past I wanted to explore new methodologies as an alternative. I got into deep learning after I found that time series are possible with recurrent neural networks. I'm specifically working with Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network due to their ability to offset the vanishing gradient problem. 

From the various examples for LSTM NNs I've been able to learn quite a bit, although none of them have addressed the problem I am trying to solve. Typically they train the model, and predict on the test set and evaluate the accuracy. I have not been able to find a solution to forecast further out into the future, beyond the test set. This repo serves as my research hub for this purpose.
